# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Why 100 Days of Code for me?
I've always enjoyed the idea of programming/coding/developing, whatever you want to call it. In some of my previous job roles, I have done a decent amount of coding, but am completely self taught - so there are gaps in my knowledge. For the past several years I have managed a team of web developers, but in this role I am strictly a manager. Not much opportunity to get my hands dirty and write code.  

Additionally, my kid is showing signs of interest, so I figured this would be a good time to take a few steps back and explore different languages, frameworks, etc. and maybe bring him along for the ride. 

### Day 1: November 24, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Created a basic compound interest calculator in Python.

**Thoughts** After explaining compound interest to the kid, I developed a bare-bones compound interest calculator. Asks for the user's input for principal, interest rate, time invested, and how often it should be compounded in a year. It walks through each step in the calculation, shows the final amount, then prompts to run it again with different values. 

Still plenty of room for improvement; need to add error handling and the option for additional investments over time.

### Day 2: November 25, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Created a stripped down version of the compound interest calculator in Python.

**Thoughts** Created a new variation of the calculator that removes the walkthrough explanation; also added the calculation as a function rather than doing the math inline.

### Day 3: November 26, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Converted the compound interest calculator to BASIC. 

**Thoughts** Because I am a fan of retro-computing, I recreated the calculator in Microsoft BASIC for the Commodore 64. I think I spent more time trying to format the text to fit a 40 column fixed width screen than anything else! The calculations are a little bit off due to limited floating-point precision. There may be ways to address this; may look into it later.

No links yet; need to figure out how to copy the code to my repo.
